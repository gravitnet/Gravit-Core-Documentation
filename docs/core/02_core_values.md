# Archaeology of Values

Five fundamental values ensuring the methodological stability of Gravit Open Network.
Values form the compass of actions, guide strategy, and ensure long-term stability.

## 1. Truth
*   **Meaning**: Discovery and confirmation of existing structures.
*   **Principle**: We do not create truth, we discover it. Meanings and structures existed before us.
*   **Effect**: Every action is checked for compliance with discovered truth.

## 2. Responsibility
*   **Meaning**: Personal, network, and historical. Fixation of every action.
*   **Principle**: Responsibility at all levels (Network, Continuum, Quantum).
*   **Effect**: Responsibility becomes the mechanism of network stability.

## 3. Coherence
*   **Meaning**: Agreement of meanings without violence, ensuring compatibility of actions.
*   **Principle**: Unity of understanding and interpretation while maintaining node autonomy.
*   **Effect**: Data and actions pass through a coherence filter, preventing chaos.

## 4. Transmission
*   **Meaning**: Reliable transmission of meanings and data between agents and generations.
*   **Principle**: Preservation of integrity during transfer.
*   **Effect**: The network becomes a system of long-term knowledge transfer.

## 5. Legacy
*   **Meaning**: Fixation of action and meaning on an eternal level.
*   **Principle**: Actions of the present become the source of culture and technology of the future.
*   **Effect**: An unprecedented layer of long-term responsibility is created.
