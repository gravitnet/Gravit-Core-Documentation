# Ontology of Gravit Open Network

## 1. Ontology of Three Paradigms

We do not create formulas of meaning; we discover existing structures.
Gravit Open Network, Continuum, and Gravit Quantum Platform are models of discovery, verification, and fixation of pre-existing semantic laws.

### Three Axes of the Cartesian System (XYZ)

Each level is orthogonal to the other. Together they create a complete space of meaning.

*   **X — Gravit Open Network**: The space of connections, routes, movement of meanings. The Network itself.
*   **Y — Continuum**: The axis of agreement, interpretation, understanding. Epistemic coherence.
*   **Z — Gravit Quantum Platform**: The axis of fixation, truth, irreversibility. The eternal foundation.

## 2. Philosophical Layer of Meaningful Actions of the Future

This layer is born from the integration of the three levels. A meaningful action is an action that has passed through three filters:
1.  It was possible (Network).
2.  It was understood (Continuum).
3.  It was fixed (Quantum Platform).

### Layer Structure

#### I. Gravit Open Network
*   **Nature**: Space, environment, topology of meanings.
*   **Function**: Does not explain meaning but gives it a path. The world of potentials.

#### II. Gravit Continuum
*   **Nature**: Coherence, verification, interpretational stability.
*   **Function**: Meaning becomes understandable. Potential transforms into a chosen vector.

#### III. Gravit Quantum Platform
*   **Nature**: Irreversibility, immutability, quantum fundamentality.
*   **Function**: Action becomes a trace. History becomes the basis of future truth.

## 3. Summary

In their totality, a space of the future is born, where meaning can live longer than its creators.
**Potential → Agreement → Eternal Fixation → Meaningful Action → Legacy**
