# Gravit Continuum (Y-Axis)

**Paradigm of Agreement and Coherence**

## Definition
Gravit Continuum is the layer of agreement, verification, and understanding. It is an epistemic mechanism that prevents the network from becoming chaos, turning it into an ordered process of exchanging truth.

## Fundamental Characteristics
*   **Y-Axis**: Axis of agreement, interpretation, understanding.
*   **Function**: Verification, ensuring coherence.
*   **Philosophical Meaning**: Precision, stability, interpretational coherence.

## Role in the System
This is the space of semantic correctness. Here, meaning becomes not just moveable, but understandable.
*   **Verification**: Checking coherence and interpretational accuracy.
*   **Correction**: Refining the direction of action.

### Action of the Future
*   Every step, every piece of information undergoes verification and integration.
*   Any initiative becomes compatible with the historical and philosophical context.
*   Continuum ensures the "translation of meaning into action," guaranteeing correct understanding and responsibility.

> **Principle**: A meaningful action must pass through the verification of understanding and coherence.
