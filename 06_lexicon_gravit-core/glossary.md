# Lexicon of Gravit Core

## Core Entities

### Gravit Open Network (X-Axis)
The decentralized infrastructure for transmission of meaning. It represents the potential, space, and the beginning of action.

### Gravit Continuum (Y-Axis)
The framework for verification, coherence, and understanding. It transforms potential into agreed vectors of action.

### Gravit Quantum Platform (Z-Axis)
The layer of eternal fixation and legacy. It ensures actions and meanings are recorded irreversibly for future generations.

## Concepts

### Three Paradigms
The collective term for the Semantic, Philosophical, and Technical unity of the Gravit system.
1.  **Semantic**: Meaning must be formalizable and verifiable.
2.  **Philosophical**: Existence as a space of discovered truth, not invented rules.
3.  **Technical**: Implementation via Multi-AI Graph Consensus and layered verification.

### Meaningful Action
An action that has passed through the cycle of Initiation (Network), Agreement (Continuum), and Fixation (Quantum), thereby becoming part of the legacy.

### Emergence
The process where the network amplifies participation and feedback to create new potentials for action, keeping the system dynamic and self-sustaining.

### Multi-AI Graph Consensus
A mechanism where truth emerges from the intersection of independent computational agents (mentioned in Technical Paradigm).

## Axes of Meaning

*   **X-Axis**: Network / Infrastructure / Potential.
*   **Y-Axis**: Consensus / Verification / Coherence.
*   **Z-Axis**: Fixation / Legacy / Eternity.
