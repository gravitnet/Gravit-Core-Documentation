# Gravit Open Network©

**The Ontological Foundation for Verifiable AI**

Gravit Open Network is an emerging decentralized infrastructure platform designed to bridge the gap between AI development and verifiable, provable logic. As of late 2025, the network positions itself not as a standard technological upgrade, but as an ontological shiftredefining the nature of how AI interacts with reality, meaningful action, and trust.

---

## The Vision: Why Gravit?

### The Problem: The "Black Box" of Trust
Modern AI systems operate as black boxes. They generate outputs with incredible speed but often lack verifiable intent, consistent logic, or an auditable trail of "meaning." In high stakes sectors legal, healthcare, infrastructure, and finance this lack of provability is a critical barrier to adoption.

### The Solution: Verifiable Intelligence
Gravit creates an ecosystem where **Trust is not assumed; it is computed.**
By integrating a multi layer architecture (L1-L2-L3), Gravit ensures that every AI action is:
1.  **Traceable** (via the Open Network).
2.  **Semantically Verified** (via the Continuum).
3.  **Optimized & Fixed** (via the Quantum Platform).

### Strategic Impact
The network aims to solve the "black box" problem by making governance and accountability a part of the core design rather than an afterthought. This moves the industry from *Artificial Intelligence* to *Verifiable Intelligence*, where the "meaning" of an action is as important as the action itself.

## The Three Pillars (Core Paradigm)

The ecosystem is organized along three axes of existence:

### 1. Gravit Open Network (X-Axis) | *The Space of Potential*
*   **Role**: Transmission & Infrastructure.
*   **Function**: A decentralized environment that evolves AI from subjective "vision" to verifiable intelligence. It replaces traditional consensus mechanisms with a continuous system of event logging and identity verification.
*   **Key Concept**: "The Network facilitates connection, but does not enforce meaning."

### 2. Gravit Continuum (Y-Axis) | *The Space of Meaning*
*   **Role**: Verification & Coherence.
*   **Function**: A framework that transforms static agreements into continuity. It acts as the semantic filter, ensuring that every operation flows logically from the last, creating a seamless chain of provable intent.
*   **Key Concept**: "Moving past discrete checkpoints to a continuous flow of truth."

### 3. Gravit Quantum (Z-Axis) | *The Space of Legacy*
*   **Role**: Fixation & Optimization.
*   **Function**: An AI-first infrastructure layer that makes trust, logic, and accountability native components. It utilizes **Gravit QRTV (Quantum Real Time Verification)** to continuously check and seal state transitions using **Post-Quantum Cryptography** (Kyber, Dilithium).
*   **Key Concept**: "The Seal of the Century — where temporary actions become eternal legacy."

## Technical Architecture

Gravit operates on a coherent **L1-L2-L3** stack designed for "Meaningful Action."

### Key Technologies
*   **Trust Engine**: A mathematical model that propagates trust across the graph using weighted vectors (Provenance, Semantic Consistency, Reputation). It uses an iterative algorithm (similar to PageRank) to compute dynamic trust scores.
*   **Simulation Framework**: A Python-based engine used to stress-test the network against specific attack vectors like Sybil Injection and Contradiction Flooding.
*   **Data Models**: Structured definitions for "Semantic Units" (L2) and "Quantum States" (L3) that allow AI agents to communicate intent unambiguously.

## Getting Started

This repository contains the full conceptual documentation and the initial Python MVP for the Trust Engine.

### Prerequisites
*   Python 3.8+
*   Standard libraries (Math, JSON, Collections)

### Quick Actions
1.  **Explore the Logic**: Navigate to `07_architecture_and_integration` to understand how the layers "talk" to each other.
2.  **Review the Trust Model**: Check `09_trust_engine/01_trust_model_theory.md` for the math behind the reputation system.
3.  **Run Simulations**: (Upcoming) Use the scripts in `10_simulation` to model network attacks and observe trust resilience.
