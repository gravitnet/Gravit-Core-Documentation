# Gravit Open Network

Gravit Open Network is a layered infrastructure designed for open,
verifiable, and long-lived systems.

It provides the conditions under which interaction, meaning,
and finality can coexist without centralized control
or hidden trust assumptions.

## Architecture Layers

### Network
The infrastructure layer responsible for connectivity, persistence,
and resilient interaction between systems and agents.

### Continuum
The semantic and verification layer where context, meaning,
and continuity are preserved across time.

### Quantum
The temporal confirmation layer where time confirms truth
by anchoring and finalizing states.

## Purpose
This repository serves as the public technical entry-point
for Gravit Open Network.

Detailed specifications, references, and implementations
will be published progressively.
