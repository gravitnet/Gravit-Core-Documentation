# Gravit Open Network (X-Axis)

**Paradigm of Network and Potential**

## Definition
Gravit Open Network is the network itself, the infrastructure for the transmission of meanings. It is not a philosophy or a semantic framework, but a structure connecting meanings, data, agents, and processes.

## Fundamental Characteristics
*   **X-Axis**: Space of connections, routes, movement of meanings.
*   **Function**: Transmission, routing, creation of connectivity.
*   **Philosophical Meaning**: Potential, space, beginning of action.

## Role in the System
This is the level where interactions appear. It does not explain meaning and does not assert truth—it creates the possibility of transmission.
It is a world of potentials, not yet formed, but already connected.

### Action of the Future
*   Any action is fixed within the context of the network.
*   A decision is not isolated but integrated into the general flow.
*   The network becomes an environment where meaning can be used and transmitted to future generations.

> **Principle**: Action is possible only where there is an infrastructure for transmission and connection.
